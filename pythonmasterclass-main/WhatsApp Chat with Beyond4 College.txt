Just to note, after college meeting today, we will have a guest speaker to share with us about Designing Online Academic Programme. It will be good because we need an academic view of things from the college perspective. 

Recently there has been many non compliance in MQA and licences have been revoked. We need to pay close attention to how we will operate the courses hereon. 

Thank you
